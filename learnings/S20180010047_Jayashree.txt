                   DEPLOYMENT

--> iam doing deployment is for transfer a file with high safety so iam using the below
1)
--> EC2
   Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) it gives scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. 
   by using this EC2 it eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. 
   it is used to launch many or as few virtual servers as you need, it configure security and networking, and manage storage. 
   
->EC2 security groups
     te grou of securty can acts as a virtual firewall that controls the traffic for one or more instances. 
     the tiem we launch an instance, we can specify one or more security groups
     otherwise, we use the default security group. 

-> SSH
   SSH uses the client-server model.
   SSH(secure shell)is usually used to log into a remote machine and execute commands and  it also supports tunneling, forwarding TCP ports also X11 connections
   ssh can transfer files using the associated SSH file transfer (SFTP) or secure copy (SCP) protocols.

-> SSH KEYGEN
    Ssh-keygen is a tool for creating new authentication key pairs for SSH. Such key pairs are used for automating logins, 
    single sign-on, and for authenticating hosts.

-> changing permission of the file
    using chmod 400 jaya1 we can change the permissions in linux

-> HTTP and ports, DNS
    DNS is only points to the IP address and has no concept of ports for older protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, and SSL. 
    The port to connect to for a particular service is determined by convention.

-> CENTOS
   it is used for updates , it is better than ubantu for updating the system
   CentOS is a Linux distribution (derived from Red Hat Enterprise Linux) 
   it is  popular with system admins, DevOps engineers, and home users alike. 
   It's also used by many organizations for development and production servers.

2)for doing this everything iam using the below things
 1) AWS ,
 2)DJANGO , AND 
 3)CENTOS. 
   

3) here my work is to login AWS and downloding the files after that changing the file with security aspects

-->Login to https://www.awseducate.com/signin/SiteLogin?ec=302&startURL=%2Fstudent%2Fs%2F
   Click AWS Account -> AWS Educate Starter Account -> AWS Console->instance-> Choose (Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type).->Choose 64-bit (x86) and click Select.- 
--> We will use 1GiB memory, 1 CPU, and IPv6 support.
--> now i just setput everything when we need to add access to HTTP to instance. This will help us to open our project website. 

-->We do not want to show our project in our system. 
  It will be better to have a .com url to access the project. 
  so we are using AWS. After a few steps, you will see, we will have a .com for our created Centos Instance.
-->to add HTTP to access our project
   now iam  jump into Section 6. (Configure Security Group). 
   Give any Security group name(like group name<jaya1>) Then add a rule.
   Type - Http. For port range section, use 80. 
   In source  use My Ip in both SSH and HTTP. Now finally move to Review and Launch. 

--> Create a new key pair with any name(ex:file name as jaya1) And then download it.
    The .pem file will be downloaded then iam accessed the server.

-->Now you have .pem file. Change permissions of the file to 400 using chmod command($>chmod 440 jaya1) 
   Now we ssh into server.
-->from the terminal, 
   ssh -i jaya1.pem ec2-user@ec2-54-234-189-46.compute-1.amazonaws.com


experiance:
  facing some issues when using chmod after that when using dns server ip address that may feel some difficulty
