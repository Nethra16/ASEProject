WORKING ON : DOCUMENTATION
REQUIREMENT: PYTHON, SPHINX.

WORK:
 -> first we will make an virtual environment. It is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects seperate by creating isolated python virtual environment. 
   following steps should be followed for installation:-
          1).To Install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper using pip
               >> pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper

          2). Set environment in folder as Env
               >> ~/.bashrc

          3). Find the virtualenvwrapper.sh file in the system
               >> sudo find / -name virtualenvwrapper.sh

          4). Edit the virtualenvwrapper.sh file with nano and change python to python3[3rd command will give path use the same path in this command.]
               >> sudo nano /path/to/virtualenvwrapper.sh

          5). Paste the source in bashrc file
               >> ~/.bashrc

          6). Now Re-activate terminal
               >> source ~/.bashrc
 -> we have completed installation now following are some command which will help us in using virtual environment.
     #]To make virtual platform/box 
        >> mkvirtualenv <projectname>   
     #]To work on that platform use command
        >> workon <projectname>
     #]To know content or freeze virtual platform use command
        >>pip freeze
     #]After completion of task we can exit by using command
        >> deactivate
     #] to delete virtualplatform use command 
        >> rm -r <projectname>
this all about creating and working with virtual environment.
=============================================================================
Once we completed installation of virtual environment. moving towards documentation. 

for making documentation. cretae virtualenvironment using the make virtualplatform command given above. 
after that gor for the following requirements.
  *Installation of sphinx
  >>pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme
  * after installation create directory 'docs' to store documentation and change directory to 'docs'.
  now to start sphinx use command 
  >> sphinx-quickstart
  after this command give the proper input according to query.
  for example(projectname,authorname are with respect to my project):-
  1]Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]: n
  2]Project name: OSINT-SPY
  3]Author name(s): Isha, Jayashree, Nethra, Pradum, Sushant, Sayam
  4]Project release []: 1.0.0
  5]Project language [en]: en
 * open file conf.py and make few changes(to support our OS)
    # import os
    # import sys
    # sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))
  change the above three lines from conf.py to 
  >>   import os
       import sys
       sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))  
 * In same file of conf.py add 'extensions' list as 
    >>    extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc'] 
    and change
   >>     html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'
 * After that to auto generate documentation of python file(path Env directory)use following command(in docs directory):
 >>sphinx-apidoc -o . ..
 [The above command will generate .rst file for the given python file.]
 >>make html
 [The above above command will amke an .html file for given or above generated .rst file.]
 Now to open html file in browser use the folowing command.
 >>xdg-open _build/html/index.html

=========================================================================

DIFFICULTIES: All sources for documentation were much older.To work on sphinx we took help from many sources and made many changes. 
=========================================================================
FUTURE PLAN: Learn much more about DJANGO, Learn TESTING.
